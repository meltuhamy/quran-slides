Quran Slides Made Easy
======================

This is a simple project I work on in my spare time.

It's a simple slide-generating web app that generates slides containing Quranic verses with english translation.

Currently, I use Shakir for English translations, but I have plans to allow the user to select a translator soon :D

I use reveal.js for actually presenting the slides, and the very helpful [global quran project](http://globalquran.com/)
for their very useful Quran API. Finally, I use the same images used in [Quran.com](http://www.quran.com) for displaying
the arabic.

Thanks to everyone who made this possible!

If you're interested in the project and would like more features, feel free to [add an issue](https://github.com/meltuhamy/quran-slides/issues)
 and I'll try and add it soon inshaAllah. Or, why not fork the project and implement them yourself?
